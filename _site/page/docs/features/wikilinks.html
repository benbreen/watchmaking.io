<h1 id="wikilinks">Wikilinks</h1>

<p>Wikilinks are the internal links that connect the files in your knowledge base.</p>

<p>To create a wikilink use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[</code> and type the name of another file in your repo, for example [<a href="graph-visualization" title="Graph Visualization">graph-visualization</a>]</p>

<p>You can also create a [[placeholder]].
A placeholder is a wikilink that doesnâ€™t have a target file and a link to a placeholder is styled differently so you can easily tell them apart.
They can still be helpful to highlight connections.</p>

<p>Open the graph with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Foam: Show Graph</code> command, and look at the placeholder node.</p>

<p>Remember, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CTRL/CMD+click</code> on a wikilink you can navigate to the note, or create it (if the link is a placeholder).</p>
